We used an ESP32 microcontroller, two potentiometers, and one rainwater sensor in our project.
One potentiometer is used to simulate the water level, and the second potentiometer is used to simulate the drainage system level.

Connections:

First Potentiometer (Water Level Simulation):

GND pin is connected to the GND of the ESP32

Signal (middle) pin is connected to an analog input pin of the ESP32

VCC pin is connected to the VCC of the ESP32

Second Potentiometer (Drainage System Control):

GND pin is connected to the GND of the ESP32

Signal (middle) pin is connected to GPIO pin 33 of the ESP32

VCC pin is connected to the VCC of the ESP32

The rainwater sensor is used to detect rainfall conditions, and based on the input from the potentiometers and the rain sensor, the ESP32 automatically controls the drainage system.

We have simulated it and we ahve seen it is working
